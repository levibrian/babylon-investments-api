### Investors:
Are you tired of always saving your information in excels? And building tenths of sheets where you always lose data?

### Developers:
Are you building THE NEXT FINANCE APP but you know nothing (nor wanna know nothing) regarding backend infrastructure, azure/aws, deploying, hosting, etc.
SAY NO MORE

Here I present you: **The IVAS (Investment Assistant) API**

With this API you will be able to save (single, multiple), delete (single, multiple), retrieve your day to day buys/sells/dividends transactions of Stocks, ETFs and Cryptos!!!.

Also, the API will build your portfolio (based on your saved transactions) and will give you your total invested, your capital gains, your realized dividends and MUCH MUCH MORE!.

All of this deployed on a secure, performant, reliable and 100% available environment called Amazon Web Services. Thanks to the AWS Cloud Services we can ensure and PROMISE you that your data is safely stored, encrypted AND AVAILABLE in a request which will take less than a second to return your results.

No need to pay any subscription!. All costs associated to the use (per request) are calculated to merely COVER the Infrastructure costs!.
Thanks for taking the time to read this small extract!. If you can, please follow us on RapidAPI for further updates!.
